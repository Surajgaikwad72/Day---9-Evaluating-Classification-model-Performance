# Day---9-Evaluating-Classification-model-Performance
I have taken a challenge to make project on every algorithm of Machine Learning. [ Day - 9 | Evaluating Classification model Performance]
Project Overview
In this project, we focus on evaluating the performance of a classification model. The evaluation process involves using various metrics and techniques to understand how well the model is performing on the given dataset. The goal is to ensure that the model is not only accurate but also generalizes well to unseen data. We will evaluate the model using different performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix.

Key Objectives
Understand Model Evaluation Metrics: Learn how to assess the performance of a classification model using common metrics.
Implement Common Evaluation Techniques: Apply various evaluation metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Handle Class Imbalance: Explore techniques to handle imbalanced classes and evaluate performance accordingly.
Visualize Model Performance: Use visualization tools such as confusion matrix plots to understand how the model performs on different classes.
